## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anton, and Iâ€™m a Junior Python Developer transitioning from a career in Project Management. My background in PM has sharpened my analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork. While Iâ€™m new to commercial Python development, Iâ€™m actively working on personal projects and eager to gain hands-on experience. Iâ€™m passionate about programming due to its problem-solving nature and growth opportunities. I have foundational knowledge in Python and practical experience with several frameworks and libraries. Iâ€™m ready to quickly learn new tools and apply them in real-world projects. Excited to leverage my skills and enthusiasm in a Junior Python Developer role!
